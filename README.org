* Nejupy - Network Competition Judge

Nejupy helps you to organize real-time programming competitions in a
network.

In a competition each contestant can access his dashboard, where he
can see the problems given and solve them by uploading his source
code.

(Human) judges can see the solution provided and ideally check if it
has succesfully compiled and has been executed producing the correct
output given some input.
